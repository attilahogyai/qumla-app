<p><span ><span ><span ><h5>Warranty Disclaimer</h5></span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span >OUR SERVICES AND ANY CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; AND &ldquo;AS AVAILABLE&rdquo;, WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span ><span ><span ><h5>Limitation of Liability</h5></span></span></span></p>

<p><span ><span ><span ><h5>Miscellaneous</h5></span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span >These Terms are the complete and exclusive agreement between you, the User, and us, Qumla, with respect to the subject matter hereof, superseding and replacing any and all prior and contemporaneous agreements, communications, and understandings (both written and oral) regarding such subject matter. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. If Qumla chooses not to enforce strict performance of any right or provision under these Terms, this shall not be construed as a waiver of such right or provision. You may not transfer or assign these Terms, or any rights and licenses granted hereunder, but Qumla&nbsp;may do so without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof will be null and void. These Terms shall be construed in accordance with the laws of Hungary, without regard to any conflict of law provisions. Notwithstanding this, either party may apply for injunctive or other equitable relief to protect or enforce that party&rsquo;s intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction where the other party resides or has its principal place of business. You agree that any cause of action that you may desire to bring arising out of or related to these Terms and/or the Services must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action arises; otherwise, such cause of action is hereby waived and permanently barred. In such jurisdictions that do not allow for the shortening of the time period in which a cause of action must be brought, the applicable time period shall be the minimum allowed by law.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span ><h5>Feedback</h5></span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span >We welcome your questions, comments and concerns. If you choose to submit such feedback to us, you agree that we are free to use this feedback in any way we see fit, without any restriction or compensation to you. Please send your feedback to:info@qumla.com</span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span ><h5>Community Guidelines</h5></span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span >The intent of this section is to clarify what we consider to be acceptable use of Qumla, Inc&rsquo;s (&ldquo;Qumla,&rdquo; &ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo;) website, [qumla.com] (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;), and Qumla&rsquo;s iPhone and other applications (those applications together with the Site, &ldquo;Service&rdquo;).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span ><h5>Redundant Content</h5></span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span >Service is not intended to be an all-purpose content aggregator. Users who import or aggregate content in a less-than-meaningful way are likely to be suspended.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span ><h5>Illegal Use</h5></span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span >Service may not be used for illegal purposes. Examples of this include using Service for fraudulent purposes or operating a phishing site (used to obtain account and password information).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span ><h5>Spam</h5></span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span >Users that do not publish meaningful content, use deceptive means to generate revenue or traffic, or whose primary purpose is affiliate marketing, will be suspended.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span ><h5>Identity Theft and Privacy</h5></span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span >Users that misleadingly appropriate the identity of another person are not permitted. Users may not post other people&rsquo;s personally identifying or confidential information, including but not limited to credit card numbers, Social Security Numbers, and driver&rsquo;s and other license numbers. You may not post information such as other people&rsquo;s passwords, usernames, phone numbers, addresses and e-mail addresses unless already publicly accessible on the Web.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span ><h5>Hate Content, Defamation, and Libel</h5></span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span >Hate speech and other objectionable content that is unlawful, defamatory, and fraudulent. Note that an allegation of defamatory expression, in and of itself, does not establish defamation. The truth or falsehood of a bit of expression is a key element in establishing defamation, and we are not in a position to make that sort of fact-based judgment. That said, if we have reason to believe that a particular statement is defamatory (a court order, for example), we will remove that statement.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span ><h5>Copyright</h5></span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span >Using copyrighted material does not constitute infringement in all cases. In general, however, users should be careful when using copyrighted content without the permission of those who created it. It is our policy to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&ldquo;DMCA&rdquo;).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span ><h5>Mass Registration and Automation</h5></span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span >Accounts that are registered automatically or systematically will be removed and access will be permanently suspended.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span ><h5>Sexually Explicit Content</h5></span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span >Accounts that regularly upload sexually explicit or pornographic material will be suspended.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span ><h5>Malicious Bigotry</h5></span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span >Don&rsquo;t actively promote violence or extreme hatred against individuals or groups, on the basis of race, ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, or sexual orientation. While we firmly believe that the best response to hateful speech is not censorship but more speech, we will take down malicious bigotry, as defined here.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span ><h5>Harm to Minors</h5></span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span >Be thoughtful when posting anything involving a minor. Don&rsquo;t post anything relating to minors that is sexually suggestive or violent. Don&rsquo;t bully minors, even if you are one. Life as a teenager is hard enough without the fear, anguish, and isolation caused by online bullying.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span ><h5>Promotion and Glorification of Self-Harm</h5></span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span >Don&rsquo;t post content that actively promotes or glorifies self-harm. This includes content that urges or encourages readers to cut or injure themselves; embrace anorexia, bulimia, or other eating disorders; or commit suicide rather than, e.g., seeking counseling or treatment, or joining together in supportive conversation with those suffering or recovering from depression or other conditions. Dialogue about these behaviors is incredibly important and online communities can be extraordinarily helpful to people struggling with these difficult conditions.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span ><h5>Gore and Mutilation Content</h5></span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span >Don&rsquo;t post gore just to be shocking. Don&rsquo;t showcase the mutilation or torture of human beings, animals, or their remains.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span ><h5>Unauthorized Sweepstakes or Giveaways</h5></span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span >Everyone wants to be a winner, but there are many reasons (including legal ones) why the Service can&rsquo;t be used for sweepstakes without our involvement and consent. If you&rsquo;re planning something like this, let us know.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span ><h5>Copyright and Trademark Infringement</h5></span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span >Respect the copyrights and trademarks of others. If you aren&rsquo;t authorized to use someone else&rsquo;s copyrighted or trademarked work (either expressly or by legal exceptions and limitations like fair use), don&rsquo;t. It is our policy to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement as per our Terms of Service and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span ><h5>Impersonation, Stalking, or Harassment</h5></span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span >Treat the community the way you&rsquo;d like to be treated. Don&rsquo;t attempt to circumvent the Block feature. If you want to parody or ridicule a public figure (and who doesn&rsquo;t?), don&rsquo;t try to trick readers into thinking you are actually that public figure.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span ><h5>Privacy Violations</h5></span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span >Don&rsquo;t use Qumla to deceptively obtain personal information. Don&rsquo;t post content that violates anyone&rsquo;s privacy, including personally identifying or confidential information like credit card numbers, social security numbers, unlisted contact information, or private photos of your ex&rsquo;s junk (no matter how attractive).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span ><h5>Disruptions, Exploits, and Resource Abuse</h5></span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span >Our servers and the valiant engineers that support them work hard for you. Don&rsquo;t attempt unauthorized use, disruption, or exploitation of Qumla or our other products and Qumla, or otherwise abuse Qumla&rsquo;s resources.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span ><h5>Unlawful Uses and Content</h5></span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span >This one&rsquo;s pretty obvious, but Qumla is not a place for illegal behavior, including fraud, phishing, or illegally inciting violence.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span ><h5>Account Termination</h5></span></span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span >If we conclude you are violating these policies, you may receive a notice via email or direct message. If you don&rsquo;t explain or correct your behavior, your account may be suspended and/or your User ID may be blocked. We do our best to ensure fair outcomes, but in all cases we reserve the right to suspend accounts or remove content, without notice, for any reason, but particularly to protect our services, infrastructure, users, or community. We reserve the right to enforce, or not enforce, these policies in our sole discretion, and these policies don&rsquo;t create a duty or contractual obligation for us to act in any particular manner. We also reserve the right to amend these policies.</span></span></span></p>
